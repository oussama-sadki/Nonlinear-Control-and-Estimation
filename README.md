Sliding Mode Control And High Gain Observer Design for Position and Angle Tracking  and Estimation: Application to a Two Degree of Freedom Robot

This project shows the results of the implementation of a nonlinear observer namely : High Gain Observer. This Observer is applied to a class of nonlinear systems, it is known with its simplicity in terms of design as only one parameter is required to be tuned.
Nevertheless, this Observer has at least a major drawback which is the choice of initial condition as it is sensitive to it. A non appropriate choice would yield poor transient performances.
That's why a prior knowledge about the initial condition is substantial to achieve good transient performances.
